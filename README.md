# Intro
This repo covers some of the creative designs that I have created as a group as well as individually. The three designs that I want to showcase are:

- The Poor Posture App Prototypes
- Furniture Design
- Virtual Currency

# Poor Posture App
- Designed extensive prototypes for an app with three group members from the
University of Toronto. The app tackles the issue of individuals suffering from poor
posture and maintaining healthy habits.
- Created low, medium, and high fidelity prototypes in Illustrator and Photoshop.
- Responsible for Prototyping, Usability Testing, User Research, Interaction and
Visual Design, and Information Architecture.
- Collaborated within a team effectively to define and improve designs based on
quantitative and qualitative data.
